# Networking

Demo page for the Demo Site Networking section.

## Mesh Topology:

In a mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via a particular channel. In Mesh Topology, the protocols used are AHCP (Ad Hoc Configuration Protocols), DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), etc.

Suppose, the N number of devices are connected with each other in a mesh topology, the total number of ports that are required by each device is N-1. In Figure 1, there are 5 devices connected to each other, hence the total number of ports required by each device is 4. Total number of ports required=N*(N-1).
Suppose, N number of devices are connected with each other in a mesh topology, then the total number of dedicated links required to connect them is NC2 i.e. N(N-1)/2. In Figure 1, there are 5 devices connected to each other, hence the total number of links required is 5*4/2 = 10.
Advantages of this topology: 

## It is robust.
The fault is diagnosed easily. Data is reliable because data is transferred among the devices through dedicated channels or links.
Provides security and privacy.
Problems with this topology: 

## Installation and configuration are difficult.
The cost of cables is high as bulk wiring is required, hence suitable for less number of devices.
The cost of maintenance is high.
